# Sports $ Casino Landing Page
This project showcases a landing page for a Sports or casino. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Description
•	Promotion - A sports or casino offering with a purpose of encouraging potential customers to sign up.

This promotions page consists of two views or filters which exist on a single page:


•	New Customers - a list of promotions only applicable to new customers.

•	All Promotions - a list of all promotions

When the page loads user lands on "All Promotions" section, further they can switch to "New Customer" section by clicking on the respective button.

### All Customers
This section has a drag and drop functionality i.e. user can re-arrange the list as per will and it automatically gets stored in the local storage.

>>API is hit only when there is no data in the localStorage otherwise even on refreshing the page data is being fetched from localStorage.

## Future Impementaions 
•Sign-Up button and Navbar can be made functional after adding the respective dedicated sections to the page/app.

•Currently a dummy footer has been placed that can be replaced with a well designed footer.


## Technologies Used

>React, CSS, JS and axios

## Available Scripts

After cloning the project on your local machine, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependency packages required.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
